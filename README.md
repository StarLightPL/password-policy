This project needs a better name. Password::Policy is just a placeholder.

Whatever I call it, it is intended to be a hierachical password policy
enforcer. The two obvious uses cases that I'm dealing with are:

1) You are running multiple sites, that all have similar but not identical
policies for password strength

2) You have multiple types of users, and want differnt strength requirements
for them. It's ok for Regular Joe to have "ilikecheese" for his password,
but an admin should be required to have a better one, etc.
